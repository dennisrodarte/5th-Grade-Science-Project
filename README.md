## Project Question

What will happen when the hydrogen peroxide and yeast mix?

## Keywords
Reaction-it’s a process  that rearranges substances 
Concentration-how much of a substance is in a solution
Decomposition- when the substance begins to break down by it’s self      
      
##  Research Description
 the substance produced is caused by  the rapid decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide,since hydrogen peroxide is dangerous we are going to lower the concentration to make it safe.  
      
## Hypothesis 
If the higher concentration peroxide produces more foam, then I know that the foam by the oxygen released due to the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide.  

## Dependent variable
- the spread of the bubbles 
- the height of the foam
## Independent variable
- concentration of hydrogen peroxide


## procedure
Caution: Wear chemical resistant gloves and goggles when handling hydrogen peroxide. Contact with skin may cause burns.

1. In a cup, dissolve 9 tablespoons of yeast in  120 mL of hot water. 
2. Place a 250-mL erlenmeyer flask in a plastic tray that is several inches deep.
3. Measure out 100 mL of the 6% hydrogen peroxide into the 250-mL flask.
4. Measure out 10 mL of concentrated dishwashing liquid into the 10-mL graduated cylinder and add it to the flask containing the hydrogen peroxide.
5.  Add a few drops of food coloring to the flask.
 Measure out 35 mL of  yeast solution using the 100-mL graduated cylinder.
7.  Quickly but carefully, add the yeast  solution to the flask.
8.  Step back and observe the reaction. Measure and record the height of the foam as it pours out of the flask. 
9. Repeat steps 3 -8 with 12% and 30% Hydrogen Peroxide.

## dependent variables 
the spread of the bubbles
volume of foam
heat generated 
## independent variabes

## conclusion
Although the distance the bubbles traveled doesn’t seem like much, the reaction was very intense.  The reaction speed was very different for the 3 concentrations, as well as the amount of foam generated. The 13.5% and 27% didn’t even give me a chance to mix it, and the 27% immediately poured out.
